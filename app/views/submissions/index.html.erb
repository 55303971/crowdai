      Note: You can select up to 2 submissions to be used to calculate your final leaderboard score. If 2 submissions are not selected, they will be chosen based on your best submission scores on the public leaderboard.

    Your final score will not be based on the same exact subset data as the public leaderboard, but rather a different private data subset of your full submissionâ€”your public score is only a rough indication of what your final score is.
    You should thus choose submissions that will most likely be best overall, and not necessarily just on the public subset.
