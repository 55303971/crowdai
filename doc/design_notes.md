Changes
- id instead of class for load-more
- removed catagory from articles masthead

Suggestions
- instead of stacking the article section titles, can we have a slider?
- Remove the superscript on the article section titles
- Additional default images, eg: for challenges, tutorials

Questions
- What to do about the shorter sections in tutorials ... see example. Should the page be set to a default height (perhaps viewport height)?
- Rails is rendering [alt=""] as [alt] - is this OK?
<img src="assets/img/tutorials/tutorial-2.jpg" alt="">
