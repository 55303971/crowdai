#### Leaderboard Position

When a participant is on a Leaderboard (ie: their top-ranked submission for a challenge), they will receive points based on their **current** position in the leaderboard.

For example if there are 100 entries in the leaderboard, and a participant is ranked 8, their reward will be 92 (100 - 8).

#### Articles

When a user creates an article and links it to their crowdAI profile, a notification will be sent to the crowdAI administrators. They can choose to make the article public, at which point the user will receive a notification and additional rewards
