### Development Standards

#### Responsiveness

crowdAI uses a combination of Rails variants and media queries built over a Twitter Bootstrap base. Rails Variants are used when a different layout is delivered by device, while media queries deliver different margins, padding, font-size etc.

crowdAI uses the following custom media queries (found in `_variables.scss`)

```
$breakpoints: (phone: 380px, tablet: 768px, desktop: 1024px);
```

They are used directly, eg:

```
@include media(">=phone", "<=tablet") { ... }
```
